# Notifiable Disease Reporting Application


Visit https://www.ndrapp.in

Its an application to store details of patients reported with an epidemic. 
This acts as an intermediate between doctors who runs small clinics or hospitals and the District medical officer. 
With this application the doctors and hospitals can report the details of the patients in daily basis. The existing System is based on pen and paper and through mail. It will only have the number of cases reported. No details of patients is included in that and its is reported on weekly basis. So it will take time to flag a place or an area regarding this epidemic.With this app the medical officer can identify the current situation of each area in real time / daily basis.
